This scientific calculator has basic functionalities, the calculator I created can perform 7 functions and the application was built by the aid of C programming language.
The user is prompted to choose one option they would love to perform first, and then the user chooses one function or operator they would love to work with.
For ex: ENTERT AN OPERATOR OF YOUR CHOICE:
       1) + For Addition
       2) - For substraction
       3) x For Multiplication
       ............
       ..............
       5) c For Cos
       6) l For log
       7) t For tan
The calculator will perform that selected function with the number of the user's choice.
After all perfomances, the system will terminate or return 0;

Thanks for any contribution for learning purpose.
